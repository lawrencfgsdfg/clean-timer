# clean timer
clean timer was meant to be placeholder name but i'm not creative

to do:
* localstorage times
* remove specified times / reset times
* ao5/ao12 calculation and other stats
* other nxn puzzle scramblers
* settings
  * background
  * font / size
  * make exportable and importable
* graphs maybe
* add timestamps to solves
* add importing for you nerds that archive times
* solve backwards compatibility... somehow
* inspection time
